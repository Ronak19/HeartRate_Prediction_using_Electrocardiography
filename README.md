# HeartRate_Prediction_using_Electrocardiography
Prediction of Bradycardia using different machine learning techniques
This is the MATLAB and android application implementation of the bradycardia detection and prediction.
The Machine learning techniques used for prediction are Decision tree, Support vector machine, Linear and Quadratic regression.

Steps for MATLAB:
1) Keep the .dat files and all the .m files in a directory
2) Run the main.m file to obtain the heartrate v/s time plot with bradycardia annotation and average heartrate and the prediction of the future heartrates or bradycardia prediction

Steps for android:
1) Keep the lay out as uploaded and run the activities on android IDEs. I have used ANdroid studio.
